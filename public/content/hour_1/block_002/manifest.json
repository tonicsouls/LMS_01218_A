        "scenario": "A cosmetology student asks you if they can use a UV sanitation device to disinfect metal shears after cutting a client's hair. They're excited because they saw a new one online for $29.99.",
        "connection": "UV sanitizers are NOT a substitute for proper disinfection with EPA-registered solutions. As an Empowered Pro, you understand that ultraviolet light can only maintain cleanliness of already-sanitized items. Using UV on a dirty implement is like putting a bandage on before cleaning the wound.",
        "law": "TDLR §83.100 specifies that UV sanitizers are only approved for storage of clean, sanitized implements. They are NOT for the sanitation, disinfection, or sterilization process itself."
